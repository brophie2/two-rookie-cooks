This is perfect to meal prep. Keeping it in the fridge for a couple of days actually helps the yolk have a more jammy texture. 

The reason we have diluted the marinade is so that it can sit in the marinade for longer without becoming overly salty. We also found that letting the eggs just sit in the marinade for a shorter period of time, to reduce the saltiness, wasn't ideal as we ended up requiring a lot more marinade which often ended up being wasted. Instead, we use the leftover marinade on our eggs, as a soup base or as a sauce with our rice/noodles.

There are lots of optional extras you can add to the marinade, such as chili, garlic or spring onions. This time, we kept it simple by just adding spring onions. 

Feel free to soft or hard boil your eggs to your liking. We chose to bring the water to a boil and then lower in the eggs for 7 minutes. Make sure to put lots of salt or vinegar in the water and have an ice bath ready for the eggs so that it makes it easier to peel. 

### Ingredients

1. Combine the soy sauce, mirin, water and sesame seeds in a bowl or container. Make sure the bowl/container is large enough to accommodate the eggs as well
