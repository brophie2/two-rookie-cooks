You know that feeling when you're sitting on a secret and you're not sure if you should share this stroke of brilliance or keep it all to yourself? Well, that was us with this recipe. 

This idea literally came to us seconds before falling asleep. In our half-asleep stupor, we wrote down this idea so that we could give it a shot the next day. We tried it, knowing in the back of our heads that if this didn't work, it was fine and we wouldn't share it. 

It might not be the most aesthetic, instagrammable food but sometimes you just have to close your eyes and give it a go. 

### Ingredients

- Oil
