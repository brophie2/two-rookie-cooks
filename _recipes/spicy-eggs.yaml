title: Spicy Eggs
excerpt: We don’t simply label recipes as our latest obsessions unless we truly can’t get enough of a meal. We made this meal 3 times this week, so I think it’s safe to say that we aren’t playing around.

  Boil the eggs to your liking - we boiled ours for 8 minutes. Don’t worry if the eggs don’t peel perfectly, because we are going to mash them up later and you won’t be able to tell. Throw together the sauce in a frying pan and toss the eggs in it.
  My favourite part about this recipe is that you can cook a double batch for dinner, so there is enough for lunch the next day, and it barely takes any additional time.
