method:
  - Slice pork into large strips, or whatever shape and size you would like your char siu
  - Combine the oil, honey, hoisin, soy sauce, brown sugar, and five spice into a large plastic bag or bowl and mix well
  - Add the pork and coat it well before marinating it in the fridge overnight (up to 1 day)
  - Cook in the oven or air fryer at 180 degrees Celsius. The cooking time will vary depending how large the pieces are. We put ours in the oven for 45 minutes and in the air fryer for 35 minutes
  - Be patient and wait at least 10 minutes to let the meat rest before you slice it and serve!

  We tried this one for no other reason than we just felt like it. I don't know why we thought it was going to be super complicated, but it's really just a matter of marinating the meat overnight and then throwing it in the oven. 

  The main difference between our version and one that you'd typically find at a restaurant is its vibrant red colour. We opted to skip the food dye mainly because we simply didn't want to buy it just to use in this one recipe. 

  We wanted to keep the recipe as simple as possible without compromising the flavour. Have you ever made char siu at home before?
