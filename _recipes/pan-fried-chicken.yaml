  For a while, we were dreaming of all the things we could make with a stainless steel frying pan that just didnâ€™t hit the same in a non-stick frying pan. One of those recipes included making the crispiest skin on a chicken thigh cutlet. We have made this a few times now and are now ready to share our secret. Slightly salt the skin and make sure the pan is nice and hot. Put the chicken in skin-side first.
