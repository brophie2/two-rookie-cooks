        notes: to taste
method:
  - Preheat the oven to 180 degrees
  - Add all dry ingredients (oats, almonds, coconut flakes, cinnamon, and salt) to a bowl. Combine well
  - "Add oil and honey to the bowl and mix well. Tip: if you put oil in your measuring cup, it will reduce the amount of honey that gets stuck"
  - Spread out evenly on a baking sheet
  - Put the tray in the oven. Stir the granola after 10 mins, and take it out after around 20 mins or once the granola is nice and toasty
  - Leave the tray out to cool for at least 30 mins. It needs to cool in the tray so that the clumps form. After this, break up the granola and store in an airtight container for as long as it lasts in your household (in ours, that's usually only a few days!)
content: You want the oats to overlap so that they can stick together. Make sure that you let it cool for long enough so that it can form big clumps.
