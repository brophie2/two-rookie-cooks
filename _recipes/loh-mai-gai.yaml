        notes: to taste
method:
  - Cut the chicken in 1 inch cubes
  - Put the chicken in a bowl with 2 tbsp of soy sauce, mirin, garlic and ginger powder. Marinate in the fridge for 30-60 minutes
  - Heat up the frying pan and cook the chicken. The aim is to get some nice colouring on the chicken, but you don't need to cook the chicken 100% as you will be adding it to the rice cooker for further cooking
  - Put the chicken aside, leaving any residual sauce in the frying pan. Alternatively, if your frying pan is big enough to accommodate the rice, feel free to leave the chicken in the pan
  - Put the rice in the frying pan along with the spring onions, reserving a little to garnish
  - Once the rice is lightly toasted, add it to the rice cooker. Add in the water, chicken, mushroom, and 2 additional tablespoons of soy sauce
  - Cook until the rice is done. There shouldn't be too much residual water once it is done
  - Stir through the sesame oil before garnishing and serving up
