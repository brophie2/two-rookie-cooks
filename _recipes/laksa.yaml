  The secret to packing in so much flavour in such a short amount of time is to use a paste and elevate the flavour by frying it for a couple of minutes. This recipe has very minimal prep and is highly customisable. For example, if you really love tau pok, aka tofu puffs, just add more! 

  And before you comment that what we are making doesn’t look like laksa, I just want to remind you that there are at least 20 different Malaysian varieties of laksa, not to mention that there are also countless more from our Singaporean, Indonesian and Thai neighbours. In Australia, we don’t have a super wide variety of Laksa pastes available so we made do with what we had and ended up combining elements from a couple of different varieties.
