  At the start, we actually found it pretty hard. The egg whites were running all over, it was hard to judge where we should put the feta, the feta made the eggs more sticky and hard to get out of the frying pan neatly - as you can see, we were clearly struggling at the start! 

  But after many attempts, we finally started to get the hang of it. So, here are a few of our tips so that if you want to try it, hopefully we can save you a few eggs:
  1) Let the feta melt and become bubbly before cracking in the egg. If you crack it in too early, the feta won't brown and then it will become a sticky mess for you, which will make it infinitely harder to take out of the frying pan.
  2) Put a bit more oil in the frying pan than you typically would if you were just frying an egg normally. The melted feta cheese likes to stick to the frying pan, even if it is a non-stick pan
  3) After you turn off the heat, wait around 30 seconds for the feta to stop bubbling and form a crust. This will also make it easier for you to get it out of the frying pan 

  Taste: 5/5 - Even our "failed" attempts still tasted awesome
  Difficulty: 3/5 - Took us a few more attempts than we thought we would need to get it right
  Would we do it again? Maybe, if we had some leftover feta
