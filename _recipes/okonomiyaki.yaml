method:
  - Mix the flour with the baking powder and salt
  - Add dashi and eggs to the flour mixture and whisk well
  - Pan fry the pork slices
  - Cut up the pork slices and add to the batter, along with the cabbage and mix well. The batter should nicely coat the cabbage and pork without having too much leftover at the bottom
  - "Add the batter to a pan. Tip: it is easier to flip if it's smaller"
  - Mix the hoisin sauce, BBQ sauce, soy sauce and ginger to create the okonomiyaki sauce substitute
  - Once the okonomiyaki is done, spread your homemade okonomiyaki sauce and drizzle some mayo. Add furikake if you have some, it'll really elevate this flavour-bomb!

  Only problem is that it traditionally calls for a lot of ingredients that we find hard to source here in Australia, so we have done a lot of experimentation to find good substitutes. 

  Is it traditional? Errrr maybe not 
  Is it delicious? Absolutely!
