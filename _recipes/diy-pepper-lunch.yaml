  Sounds too good to be true. We knew we had to try it out and this is our honest review. 

  Did we see this going around Instagram and TikTok? Yes!
  Did we need to jump on the hype? Absolutely!
  Honest ratings? 11/10, most definitely doing this again!!

  We loved it. Actually, "loved" is not enough to convey how much we enjoyed this meal. We absolutely devoured it and you best believe we made it again the next day because we couldn't get enough of it. So much easier than we thought and so delicious. 11/10!
