  About a year ago, we went to a dumpling restaurant and a plate of 8 dumplings cost us $18 (AUD)! Considering it was just a regular plate of pan-fried dumplings, it felt pretty pricey. This sent us on a quest to learn how to make these at home.

  Throughout this journey, these are our top 3 learnings:
  1) It is soo much cheaper to make these at home
  2) Enlisting friends to help you fold makes it so much faster and also is so much fun
  3) There are so many different flavour combinations that aren't typically served at restaurants that are delicious!

  At first, we started out buying the dumpling skins. Overall, it would cost us roughly $5 per serve (12 dumplings). However, once we started making the dumpling dough ourselves, we've probably brought the cost down to $2.50! Let us know if you would like us to share our super easy and cheap dumpling dough recipe.

  You can also easily freeze the dumplings. After you fold them (do not cook them!), put them on a tray in the freezer. It's important that they don't overlap, otherwise they will all become stuck together. After they have been in the freezer on the tray for around 1-2hrs, you can transfer them from the tray into a container/bag for easier storage. They shouldn't stick together anymore. When you are ready to cook them, make sure to not defrost them. Instead, just put them straight into a frying pan or boil them.

  It's honestly pretty therapeutic to make the dough and fold the dumplings. We love to invite friends over and make it together.

  Serves 2 (around 24 dumplings)
