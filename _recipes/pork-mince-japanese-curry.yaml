excerpt: The other day, I woke up with a really strong craving for a Japanese curry with sweet potato and zucchini, which made absolutely no sense because I don’t think I’ve ever had that exact combination before.

  Fortunately, it turned out pretty well and that craving was definitely satisfied by the time I had my third serving of this. It freezes pretty well and is easy to bulk cook, making it a great candidate for meal prepping. Switching up what you serve with it can also help to keep it exciting. I always have a soft spot for udon, but it also tastes good with rice.
