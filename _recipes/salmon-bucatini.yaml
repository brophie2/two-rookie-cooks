  I’m always on the hunt for a good bargain, and when I stumbled across half price fresh salmon fillets, which, by the way, I don’t think I have ever seen before, I knew I had to get some! Crack a little salt on the salmon skin and pan fry it. The capers are a must, because they cut through the oiliness perfectly, and the chili adds a little kick. Make sure to give the pasta a really good toss in that fragrant oil. Just like that, dinner is served!
