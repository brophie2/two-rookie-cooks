content: This recipe follows the simple ratio of 4 parts plain flour to 1 part hot water (with salt). If the dough is too sticky, gradually add more flour. If the dough is too tough, gradually add some hot water. The general rule of thumb is approximately 1/2 cup flour will equate to about 10-12 dumpling skins, so this recipe should make enough for 4 people (or 3 very hungry people).
