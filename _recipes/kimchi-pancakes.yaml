method:
  - Cut the kimchi into thin slices and cut spring onions on a bias. Also thinly slice the onion
  - In a bowl, combine plain flour, corn flour and the gochugaru and mix well
  - Next, add the kimchi juice and cold water, and mix very well. You want to ensure that the is really smooth and definitely has no lumps in sight before proceeding
  - Add the onion, spring onion and kimchi to the batter and mix
  - Coat the frying pan with around 1 tsp cooking oil
  - Scoop some batter onto the frying pan and make sure that it is a thin, even layer
  - Once the batter at the top has changed to a darker hue and a nice crust is forming on the bottom, flip the pancake
  - While the pancake is cooking, combine all the dipping sauce ingredients in a small saucer/bowl
  - After the pancake has finished cooking, pop it onto a plate and cut it up into smaller pieces. Continue cooking until you have finished the batter. It should be around 4-6 pancakes, depending how large they are
content: No, you definitely don’t need to reach for that ready-made pancake mix. You just need some corn flour. The first time we made this, we did not use corn flour because a bunch of recipes we found online said that it was optional. Let’s just say that you’ll never catch us making kimchi pancakes without corn flour ever again!
