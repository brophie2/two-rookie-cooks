      unit: tbsp
  - name: dashi
    quantity:
      amount: 1/2

    notes: (we mixed 1 tbsp dashi powder with 1/2 cup water)
  - name: soy sauce

      unit: tbsp
  - name: mirin
    quantity:

      unit: tbsp
  - name: Cooked rice
  - name: Furikake
method:
  - Cut the chicken into cubes and marinate with the sake
  - Slice the onion
  - Combine the dashi, soy sauce and mirin in a bowl
  - Put the onion and the sauce you made in step 3 into a frying pan and let it cook a little
  - Add chicken to the frying pan
  - Crack the eggs and 'cut' the egg whites with chopsticks  until the eggs are marbled (not beaten!)
  - Once the chicken is mostly cooked through, top it with the 2/3 of the eggs. Try and pour the egg whites first as they take longer to cook
  - Once the egg has set, pour the remaining egg mixture around the edges of the frying pan
  - Once the eggs are all set, serve it up immediately on top of rice and enjoy. Optionally top with some furikake
content: One day, we were both really craving oyakudon. This came shortly after we moved to a new city, so neither of us really knew any good Japanese places nearby that served this. We figured that since we already had most of these ingredients, we'd try making it and we were pleasantly surprised at how quickly it all comes together. Fast forward and this has become one of our go-to weeknight staples.
