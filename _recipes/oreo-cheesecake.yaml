  - For about 60% of the Oreos, put the cookies into a blender and put the cream in a separate bowl. Break up the cream chunks before whisking into the cream cheese mixture
  - Blend the cookies until it is a fine crumb
  - For the remaining Oreos, roughly chop them before folding them into the cream cheese mixture
  - In a glass container or cake tin, combine the Oreo cookie crumbs and melted butter. Use the back of a spoon to flatten it. Pour over the cream cheese mixture and ensure there are no air bubbles.
  - Put in the fridge for at least 3-4 hours, or ideally, overnight

  Mix the icing sugar into the thickened cream, and then gradually pour this into a bowl with the cream cheese. You’ll need to whisk pretty hard, so it’s basically a free arm workout.  Separate some of the Oreo cookies from the cream. Whisk the cream into the cream cheese, and blitz the cookies. Combine the cookie crumbs with melted butter, and press firmly into your tin or container. Roughly chop up the remaining Oreos, and fold this into the cream cheese mixture. Pour this over the base and refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours, or overnight. The longer, the better, because it will get firmer and be easier to cut.
