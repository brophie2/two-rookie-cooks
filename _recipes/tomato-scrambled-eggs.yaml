  Last night, just as I was falling asleep, I had this idea of making scrambled eggs with pizza flavours. Now, not all of my late night ideas are a stroke of genius but I really think that this one was. Before you call me crazy, tomato and eggs are a great combination that weâ€™ve seen in many well-loved dishes, like Chinese-style tomato egg stir-fry and shakshouka. All this is, is eggs with some extra tomatoey, herby flavours to make an ordinary breakfast, something extraordinary.
