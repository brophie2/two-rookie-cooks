content:  We don't need to wash a knife and chopping board and it's really quick to prepare. If you are going to pan-fry these, you will not regret using 2 rice paper rolls per dumpling to make sure that it doesn't leak. It will also mean that the outside can get nice and crispy while the inner layers are still soft and chewy.
