  The tricky part of making fresh noodles at home is that it requires a lot of space to roll out the dough or takes a while to master the proper technique. 

  The texture is a bit chewy and definitely has a nice bounce to it, similar to udon noodles. If you're a fan of udon, we urge you to try out this recipe at home!
