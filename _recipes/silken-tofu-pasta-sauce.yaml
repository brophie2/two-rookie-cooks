title: Silken Tofu Pasta Sauce 
excerpt: I like dairy, but I’m not really sure that it likes me back. As such, I’ve been on a quest to figure out how to make the ultimate dairy-free sauce that is silky smooth, and doesn’t compromise on taste or satisfaction, and I think that this silken tofu sauce really hits the spot.

  - While that is cooking, add the silken tofu and water to a blender and blend for around 30 seconds, or until it is smooth

  - Stir the cheese through and serve up

  It does have a mild tofu taste if you eat it straight, but once you season it a little and toss the pasta in it, you’ll barely notice it. This might be a little controversial but I actually think that this is better than using cream.
