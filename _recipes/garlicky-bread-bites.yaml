          unit: cup
      - name: white sugar

      - name: Extra virgin olive oil
      - name: Flaky sea salt
method:
  - Combine the warm water and yeast together, and let it sit for a few minutes to activate. Once there are bubbles forming, it's ready
  - In a large bowl, add the plain flour and a pinch of salt (normal salt, not the flaky kind just yet) and mix
  - Add sugar to the yeast mixture once it is ready and then pour it into the flour
  - Use a spatula to mix the dough. You will probably need to knead it with your hand towards the end
  - Cover with a tea towel and set aside until it has doubled in size
  - Once the dough has risen. generously grease a muffin tin and portion the dough equally. Cover with a tea towel and let it rise again
  - Preheat the oven to 190 degrees celsius
  - Dimple the dough and push the garlic slices into the dimples. You need to push them in quite far otherwise they may burn quickly. Sprinkle with some flaky sea salt
  - Put it into the oven and bake for around 20-25 minutes, or until golden

  That was what we intended on making. However, these didn't end up being as air-y and were waaay too crusty for it to really be considered as focaccia anymore. We decided, though, that they tasted too good to not still share them, even though it didn't quite work out as we planned.
