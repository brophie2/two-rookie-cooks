  To be completely honest, we just didn't make Ipoh Hor Fun because by the time the idea came to us, we were simply too lazy to go to the grocery to get all the missing ingredients so we improvised a little. 

  Just like all soups, the longer you cook, the better the flavour. We cooked ours for about an hour before we got too hungry/impatient and ate it. The flavour also intensifies if you leave it sitting in the fridge overnight. Our leftovers the next day tasted superb.
