method:
  - Combine plain flour and salt in a large bowl
  - Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water and let it rest for 2-3 minutes or until little bubbles form
  - Add the mixture to the large bowl and mix. Once the flour is mostly incorporated, give the dough a quick knead in the bowl
  - Use oil to grease another larger bowl, place the dough inside and cover with a tea towel for around 30-60 minutes, or until the dough has risen
  - Preheat the oven to 180 degrees celsius
  - Grab around 2-3tbsp dough and stretch it into a circle with your hands
  - Put a spoonful each of peanut butter and jam inside, and pinch to seal
  - Optionally drizzle a bit of melted butter over the top before baking in the oven for around 40 minutes, or until golden and crusty
