  Well, until today, neither had we. It takes way less time than it would on a frying pan, plus you can cook your veggies at the same time and you have a perfectly balanced meal done in 25 minutes.
  A downfall, though, is that you don’t really get the same browning on the meatballs as you would in a frying pan. We did try to crank up the heat but it wasn’t quite the same.
  Nevertheless, if you are prepping these ahead of time, you probably would be able to notice a difference in texture after they’ve been in the fridge. Let’s just say that we rate this for meal prepping but if you’re going to eat it straightaway, we’ll probably be sticking to using a frying pan.
