  - ingredients:
    - name: butter
      quantity:
        amount: 70
        unit: g
      notes: (40g for the dough, 30g for the filling)
    - name: milk
      quantity:
        amount: 1
        unit: cup
      notes: (can be any milk, we used soy milk)
    - name: yeast
      quantity:
        amount: 2
        unit: tsp
    - name: white sugar
      quantity:
        amount: 4
        unit: tbsp 
      notes: (2 tbsp for the dough, 2 tbsp for the filling)
    - name: brown sugar
      quantity:
        amount: 2
        unit: tbsp
    - name: bananas
      quantity:
        amount: 3-5
        unit: medium
      notes: (2-3 bananas for the dough, 1-2 for the filling)
    - name: all purpose flour
      quantity:
        amount: 3
        unit: cups
    - name: salt
      quantity:
        amount: 1
        unit: pinch
    - name: ground cinnamon
      quantity:
        amount: 1-2
        unit: tbsp
method:
  - Microwave the milk and butter until the butter is completely melted, and let it cool so that it is not too hot and kills the yeast (if you can comfortably leave your finger in the mixture, then it is probably ok)
  - Add the yeast and let it sit for around 10 minutes. The yeast will be activated when you see bubbles forming
  - Add sugar and salt to the mixture and stir well 
  - In a large bowl, mash the bananas 
  - Pour the yeast mixture into the bananas and stir
  - Add the flour in gradually (we did 1/2 cup at a time) and mix with a spatula until a dough forms. This should be after around 3 cups of flour. You may also need to knead the dough with your hands a bit if it is getting too hard to use a spatula 
  - Lightly oil another bowl and transfer the dough into that bowl. Let the dough rest for around 1hr, or until it has doubled in size
  - Preheat the oven to 175 degrees celsius. Roll out the dough into a large rectangle
  - Melt the butter (from the filling ingredients) and spread evenly. Reserve the leftover butter for later
  - Combine the brown sugar, white sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle generously over the butter
  - Lay the banana slices over the cinnamon sugar
  - Roll the dough into a log and cut into slices that are around 1 inch
  - Put scrolls into a tray and put remaining butter on top, to help the scrolls turn a nice golden brown colour
  - Once the oven is hot, bake the scrolls for around 30 minutes

  Well, then it's time for another banana recipe! We are trying to step outside of our comfort zone (ie. banana bread) and this was what we made today. Although it does take a bit more time and effort than our usual recipes, it is pretty tasty. It's also (unintentionally) reasonably low in sugar, with most of the sweetness coming from the bananas. 

  Let us know if you give this recipe a try.
