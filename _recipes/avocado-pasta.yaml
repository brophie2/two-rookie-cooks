      notes: (we chose fusilli because it catches teh sauce well)
method:
  - Boil some water for your pasta
  - Chop your bacon and sundried tomatoes and start frying the bacon
  - Add the avocado, spinach and garlic cloves to a blender
  - After you have started boiling the pasta, add some of the starchy water to the blender
  - Blend the sauce. Keep adding water until you reach the desired consistency. We added around 1/2 cup of starchy pasta water
  - Drain your pasta, and add the sundried tomatoes, sauce and pasta to the bacon. You'll notice that the sauce will turn a darker green colour once it touches the heat, due to the spinach in the sauce. Make sure you keep stirring!
  - Time to plate up and devour your masterpiece
