  When we first told our friends we were gonna start filming our cooking, one of them repeatedly requested that we made a chicken nugget recipe. Admittedly, we put this off for a little while because we weren't quite sure how to make it and thought it was going to be tedious. But after a lot of brainstorming, we finally figured out an easy way to make them! So thank you for being so persistent in asking us to make this. If not, we wouldn't have realised how easy it was to make these at home (Macca's better watch out ðŸ‘€).

  If you use chicken mince, you can skip freezing it because you don't need to coat it in flour and egg to make the breadcrumbs stick - you can press it tightly against the mince and it'll stick! Once we figured this out, it was a game changer.
