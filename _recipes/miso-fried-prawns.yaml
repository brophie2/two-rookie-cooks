  You're probably familiar with the typical way of coating anything that you want to deep fry or bake in flour, then egg, and finally in a bread crumb. But in this (mild) egg crisis we have, we can't afford to be using eggs like this, because it often ends up with a bunch of leftovers that get wasted. And sure, you can make an omelette with the leftover eggs, but what if we could avoid this whole situation?

  We wanted to experiment by substituting the egg with something that would help the bread crumbs stick, as well as being tasty. We found that slightly diluting miso paste was surprisingly effective, as it provides a nice saltiness and the bread crumbs stick quite well.
