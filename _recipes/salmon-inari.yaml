title: Salmon Inari
excerpt: A problem I sometimes have with Inari, especially when we go out to eat, is  that I struggle to get the perfect bite that has the correct ratio of rice to toppings.

      - name: Tofu pockets
        quantity:
          amount: 10 - 12
method:
  - To a rice cooker, add uncooked rice and water. Place the salmon on top of the rice and cook
  - Once the rice cooker is done, fluff up the rice to help it to cool and gently flake the salmon apart. Set aside to cool
  - After it has cooled, mix in the rice vinegar and gochugaru
  - Open up the tofu pocket and use a spoon to scoop the rice mixture into it. Use your thumbs to pack the rice in firmly, but be careful not to rip the pockets as they are quite delicate. We managed to fit around 4-5 tbsp in each pocket
  - Sprinkle with some spring onion and serve up

  To fix this, I decided to break up the salmon so that there are little flakes incorporated into every single bite. However, this makes the rice mixture a lot less sticky, so it becomes a little more fiddly to pack into the tofu pockets. Nevertheless, it did solve my initial problem so I still consider this a win.
