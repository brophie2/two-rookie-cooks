  - Add the remaining ingredients to the bowl and mix well 
  - Lay the mixture flat on a sheet pan. Make sure that it overlaps so that it can form clumps 
  - Put the tray into the oven for 20 minutes. Halfway through, you will need to take it out of the oven to toss so that it doesn’t burn

  Homemade granola hits different! I don’t know why it's so addictive but it just is. We eat it for breakfast, we’ll snack on it throughout the day and have a little bit more for dessert after dinner. Before we know it, the big batch that we made over the weekend that was supposed to last us for a couple of weeks is gone in a couple of days. Do we have a serious problem?
