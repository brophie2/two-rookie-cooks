  To make the sauce, just add tahini, peanut butter, soy sauce, spring onions and some starchy noodle water into the bowl that you are going to eat out of and stir vigorously, until it is smooth and runny. And yes we are primarily mixing the sauce in the bowl that we are going to eat out of to save washing up, but also to minimise sauce wastage. Add your cooked noodles and serve with any protein or vegetables that you have.
