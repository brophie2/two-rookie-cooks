  - Remove salmon and cook the onion and garlic
  - Add the sundried tomato to the pan to cook for a minute
  - Add stock and let it reduce a little. We recommend getting it to a boil for around 30 seconds
  - Add heavy cream and stir until well combined
  - Add spinach and stir until it has wilted
  - Add salmon back to the pan and coat it well with the sauce
  - Optionally sprinkle some grated parmesan on top and enjoy

  Why haven't we made it since that date? We're honestly not sure why we hadn't made it again sooner, but we will be adding this to our rotation of quick weeknight dinners. 

  It's another simple 1 pan dish that takes under 25 min to come together. It can be eaten on its own, or with a piece of toast or some pasta.
