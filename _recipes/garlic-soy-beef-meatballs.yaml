  The rice inside gives it a nice bite-y texture, while the rice on the outside, and the grains that fall out, gets nice and crispy. I would strongly recommend using brown rice, over white rice, because it has a nutty flavour that goes really well with the sauce. This meal can easily be made in bulk and I reckon it tasted even better the next day. There are endless options of what you can serve these meatballs with, but our favourite is some broccolini and brown rice.
