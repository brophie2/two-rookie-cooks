  Make sure you get a pasta that has lots of ridges and curves to catch the pesto. We chose to use fusilli for this recipe. 

  Once again, top this with anything of your choosing. We decided to keep it simple by just adding broccoli, but there are so many vegetables and meat that pair really well with this pesto; the options are endless so get creative!
