title: Army Stew
excerpt: It is hopefully one of the last few cold days here in Australia and we had to make this one last time before it gets too hot for soup.

    amount: 100g

    amount: 1
  - name: packet of Shin Ramen
    amount: 1
  - name: tteokboki, or to your liking
    amount: 12 -16
methods:
  - Slice the tofu and spam into large squares, ensuring that the tofu is not too thin so it doesn't crumble. Cut the fish cakes into triangles or other bite-sized pieces
  - Cut the cup mushrooms into quarters and tear the enoki mushrooms into smaller chunks
  - Thinly slice the spring onion, reserving some of the greens to garnish
  - Add the silken tofu, spam, fishcakes, enoki mushrooms and cup mushrooms into a pot/large pan evenly. Place the kimchi, gochujang, soy sauce, spring onions and Shin ramen seasoning into the middle, and pour the stock on top. Cover with a lid and bring to a simmer
  - Once simmering, add tteokboki and shin ramen noodles. After around 2 minutes, turn off the heat and let the residual heat cook the rest of the noodles/tteokboki

  We definitely added too much water so don't fall into the same trap as us! We forgot that our ingredients were floating up, so it kept looking like we needed more water when we didn't really. Don't worry, we have adjusted the amount of water in the recipe below. 

  Typically, people use a larger, flat pan to cook army stew. Since we don't have one, we just used a large pot. It might not have looked as appealing, as you need to fish down quite far into the pot to get the goodies, but we can assure you that it still tastes great.
