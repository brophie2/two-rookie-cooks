  It only takes 20 minutes to make and I find it kinda hard to justify spending $15-20 on it, when I know I can easily do it at home. Just chop up your choice of protein and vegetables, make a tasty sauce and toss it together in a wok. Do you have a dish that is so easy to make that you refuse to order it from a restaurant?
