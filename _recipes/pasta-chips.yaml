  Today we chose to eat it with some homemade pesto aioli. Honestly, I really wanted to like it but it was just a tad underwhelming, especially for the amount of effort it took. I think that an easier way to achieve something pretty similar is to do a pasta bake and let a bit of the pasta stick out of the sauce so it can get a bit crispy.
