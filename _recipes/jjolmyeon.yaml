  It’s a Korean cold noodle dish. The noodles are delightfully chewy, and soak up flavour really well. It’s paired with a spicy sauce, that’s also a little sweet and vinegar-y. You can control how spicy you would like your sauce by adjusting how much gochujang you put in. These noodles are so addictive and would highly recommend you give it a go too!
