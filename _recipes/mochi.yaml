  - Set aside to cool for roughly 15 minutes
  - Scoop around 1 tbsp of the mochi and coat thoroughly with corn flour
  - Pull the dough into a flat circle and put around 1/2 tsp of Anko paste inside. Roll the dough to form a ball again
  - Dust it again with corn flour and eat

  Today, we were reminded that we are simply 2 rookie home cooks that sometimes have no idea what we are doing in the kitchen. We've been seeing a lot of people making mochi recently and thought we would give it a go as it looked reasonably easy. How wrong we were 

  We severely underestimated how sticky the mochi dough is, especially when it is not cooked enough. Make sure that you have plenty of corn starch available and let the dough cool sufficiently, otherwise you will have a sloppy, sticky, runny mess.
