method:
  - Wash the rice and start cooking it
  - Finely dice your white onion and garlic
  - Put the white onion and garlic in a frying pan until the onions are transparent
  - Add the mince to the frying pan
  - Once the mince is halfway cooked, season it with the chipotle seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Take it off the heat once it is fully cooked.
  - Dice the tomatoes and red onion
  - Add the tomatoes and 2/3 of your diced red onion to a bowl, along with 2 tbsp of lime juice. Season with salt and pepper before stirring and putting this aside
  - Combine the remaining diced red onion with the corn and 2 tbsp of lime juice. Season with salt and pepper before stirring and putting this aside.
  - Mash the avocado and season with 1 tbsp lime juice, salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder
  - Cut the tortillas into chip-like shapes and put them into the frying pan. It's good to do this after frying the mince so you can soak up any residual flavours in the pan
  - Serve up! Don't forget to add some sour cream and cheese if you like
