title: Bolognese Pies
excerpt: If you're anything like me, you can't stand eating the same meal 5 days in a row so when I meal prep, everything needs to be just how I like my functions when I code - modular. These pies are a great way to switch things up and make leftovers cool again.

content: When we were writing this recipe, we realised that we didn't really know how to represent how much bolognese sauce we used. Technically, we almost filled a 1L container with bolognese, which we eyeballed was probably around 3 cups.
