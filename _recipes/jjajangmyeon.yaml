  If you've never tried this dish before, it's a Korean-Chinese noodle dish. It's saucy and really tasty, and you should definitely try it!

  Make sure that when you are frying the black bean paste you have sufficient oil so that it doesn't burn and have a bitter taste. Frying the paste is a crucial step, as otherwise, the sauce will taste quite bitter. The flavours also intensify a lot when you fry it, so do not skip this step!
