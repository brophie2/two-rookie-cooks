  Right now, it’s absolutely freezing in Finland so coming inside and eating a hearty, warm soup is perfect. I knew instantly that when I got home, I would need to learn how to make this. 

  A challenge we had was that fish stock was hard to find at the shops. Yes, we definitely could have made some homemade fish stock but we just didn’t feel like it, so we thought we would try substituting it with vegetable stock. It definitely doesn’t have such a strong salmon taste, however, it is still pretty delicious if you can’t easily access or make your own fish stock.
