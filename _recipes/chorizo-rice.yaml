method:
  - Dice the onions and capsicum, and finely mince the garlic
  - Either slice the chorizo or take it out of its casing, and panfry until it is nicely browned
  - Put the chorizo aside and panfry onions and garlic until fragrant
  - Add the capsicum, washed rice, paprika powder and tomato paste into the frying pan and toast for a couple of minutes
  - Add stock and chorizo, and cover with a lid for 12-15 minutes, or until the rice is cooked. Stir the rice every 5 or so minutes to ensure that it cooks evenly
content: If you have an extra 5-10 minutes to spare, you can leave the rice in the pan without the lid on so that it forms a nice crust underneath.
