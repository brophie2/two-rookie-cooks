  When you think of how to make a creamy pasta sauce, you're probably thinking of a classic carbonara, which is made with parmesan cheese and egg yolks, or an alfredo sauce, which uses heavy cream. However, there aren't many classic creamy sauces that use yoghurt for a base (or that we've heard of). 

  We were also a bit skeptical to try this out but were pleasantly surprised when we tried it and you should definitely give it a go too!
