  Maybe it was just us?

  Let us assure you that this was truly a flavour bomb. The first time we made these, we weren't quite sure if they were going to make the cut or if we were going to post this recipe. We both took our first bite, looked at each other and KNEW that this was a winner. It's salty, juicy, has the perfect amount of bite and leaves you feeling warm. 

  In any case, this experimentation ended up going well. We were really nervous because there were quite a few new things we were trying out for the first time. 

  We used the chicken mince as our binding agent for the dumpling filling. Although miso soup doesn't typically contain any chicken, the soup base is sometimes a chicken broth. Chicken mince is also probably one of the milder flavours of minced meat, which was crucial for this recipe so that the miso soup could really be the star. 

  We also flavoured the dough with dashi. Dashi is the generic term used to describe stocks in Japanese cuisine. They do have a particularly unique flavour, so substituting this with regular stock probably won't yield the same flavour, so we urge you to go to your local Asian grocery to get this, or better yet, make it yourself. We did, however, just use some instant dashi powder this time. 

  Overall, this was a massive success and has definitely been one of our favourite dumpling flavours so far. 

  If you're not drooling by now, why did you even read this far?
