      - name: Uncooked pasta
method:
  - Thinly slice the brown onions and preheat the frying pan
  - Add oil, the onions and the brown sugar. Let this caramelise for at least 15-20 minutes
  - While it is caramelising, finely dice garlic and slice mushrooms
  - Once the onions are sufficiently caramelised, add in the mushrooms, garlic and worcestershire sauce
  - After the mushrooms have got a little colour, add the beef stock and water. Bring it to a simmer
  - Add in the pasta and ensure that there is enough liquid to cover the pasta. If there is not, feel free to stir the pasta every few minutes so that it cooks evenly or add in a little bit more water
  - Once the pasta is cooked, add in the heavy cream, parmesan cheese, and thyme and turn off the heat. Stir through well

  I should note, though, that this recipe does take a little while because you need to caramelise the onions and then cook the pasta in the same pan. It’s important to take your time to caramelise the onions so that you develop a deep, rich flavour. The acidity of the Worcestershire sauce cuts through the creaminess, and the thyme is a nice fresh touch.
