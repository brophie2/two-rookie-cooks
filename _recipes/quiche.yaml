  You can put anything you want inside, but we opted for broccoli this time. We would also recommend mushroom, leek, kale, or cherry tomatoes. 

  Making them in a muffin tray, as opposed to using larger tin, helps them cook quicker. An added bonus is that they are nicely portioned which makes storage and re-heating easier. This is an excellent idea for meal-prepping, as they store in the fridge or freezer well, and can be reheated in the oven or microwave.
