  - Place chicken on top
  - Turn on the rice cooker (we used the quick cook setting on ours)
  - While it is cooking, inhale the aromas and salivate
  - Make some spring onion oil by frying the spring onions in a small pot. We used a small pot so that there wasn't as much oil splashing outside
  - Once the spring onions are fried, set it aside in a bowl and add 2 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp sesame oil
  - Once the rice cooker is done, wipe the drool away before anyone notices and eat immediately

  For those of you too lazy to scroll down and read the recipe, let me summarise it for you here. Just toss in all the ingredients into the rice cooker, start the rice cooker and eat.   

  We decided to get a little bit fancy and make a sauce to go with it. It's totally optional but it's a good activity to do while you are waiting for the rice cooker and it makes the dish so much better. Scroll to the bottom to find this recipe.
