ingredients:
  - name: frozen mixed berries
    quantity:
      amount: 3
      unit: cups
  - name: white sugar
    quantity:
      amount: 1
      unit: cup
  - name: lemon juice
    quantity:
      amount: 1
      unit: tbsp
method:
  - Put all ingredients into a pot on medium heat and stir
  - Check the jam every 5 minutes and give it a stir. You may also wish to squish the berries so that they cook faster and will help the finished product be smoother without requiring a blender
  - After around 30 minutes in total, the jam should be the right consistency. Check with the frozen spoon trick
  - Store the jam in an airtight container for up to 1-2 weeks in the fridge
content: A neat trick to check if the jam is ready is to put some spoons in the freezer at the start. If you can coat the back the frozen spoon and the jam doesn't really run off very quickly, then it should be ready. Note that the jam will significantly thicken after you take it off the heat to cool, so don't worry if it still seems quite runny.
