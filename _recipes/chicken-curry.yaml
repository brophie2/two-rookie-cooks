method:
  - Wash rice and add it to the rice cooker. Start the rice cooker
  - Soak bean curd sticks in hot water to rehydrate for around 5-10 minutes, or until soft. Drain once they are soft
  - Cut chicken thighs into small bite-size cubes
  - Cut potatoes into a similar size
  - Fry the curry paste in some oil until fragrant. This will only take around 1-2 minutes
  - Add chicken and cook for a few minutes
  - Add potatoes, beancurd sticks, coconut milk and water. Stir and cover with a lid to boil
  - Let it boil for a few minutes and then turn the heat off. Leave the lid on until the rice cooker is done
content: A common misconception is that curry takes a long time to cook and is hard. However, if you use a curry paste, it can actually be quite a quick meal that is packed with flavour and will leave you with leftovers for the next day.
