  In the spirit of trying out new flavours of dumplings, we experimented with creating a garlic butter prawn dumpling. The butter helps the prawns to stay nice and juicy and the extra garlic makes sure the vampires stay far, far away. 

  And because we like garlic a lot, we decided to make a garlic oil to go on top.
