  Whenever we create a new recipe, we go back and forth thinking of what we should call the recipe. Often, the name is too long or we don't really feel that it is representative of what we just made. Just in case it wasn't already clear, we had some trouble finding a good name that did these meatballs justice. 

  The flavours are somewhat Asian inspired, but not necessarily any particular cuisine. All we know is that they tasted yummy and we wanted to share this with you.
